# ece-128-lab7
The objective of this ECE 128 Lab#7 group assignment was to provide a comprehensive understanding of various digital circuit designs and their implementations using Verilog. The specific objectives were as follows:
To create and analyze the functionality of an SR latch and an SR flip-flop.
To design and implement a posedge-triggered D flip-flop with synchronous and asynchronous reset.
To design a posedge-triggered T flip-flop and use it to create a 3-bit counter.
To create a clock divider that provides a 25 MHz frequency.
